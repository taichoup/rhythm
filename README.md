This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Deployment

### `pnpm predeploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### `pnpm run deploy`

publishes to [https://taichoup.github.io/rhythm](https://taichoup.github.io/rhythm) through the gh-pages branch and lib. See [this article](https://dev.to/kathryngrayson/deploying-your-cra-react-app-on-github-pages-2614) for more info on how this works.
